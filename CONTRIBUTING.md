# Contributing into Distributed Trace Context

This repository is being used for work in the [W3C Distributed Trace Context Working Group](https://www.w3.org/community/trace-context/).

Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the
[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/) and
[Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software). To make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate
in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

``` bash
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

``` bash
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
